# Data Science & Machine Learning Portfolio

This repository showcases a diverse range of projects where I apply data science, machine learning, and cloud/web deployment techniques. Each project highlights a different aspect of my skill setâ€”from data analysis and visualization in Python and R to full-stack web applications using Django/React.

## Bird Ecological Health Analysis

### Overview

This project focuses on analyzing bird population data in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE). It combines:
- **Python** scripts for data ingestion, exploratory data analysis, and high-quality visualization.
- **R** scripts for advanced statistical modeling (GAMYE models) and interactive dashboards with Shiny.
- **Web** projects using Django and React to create interactive dashboards and APIs.

### Projects & Code

- **Python Modules:**  
  - **Species_plots.py:** Generates species-specific abundance plots with dynamic configuration using JSON.
- **R Modules:**  
  - **GAMYE_Cluster_Modified.r:** Implements advanced species trend modeling with GAMYE and parallel processing.
  - **app.R:** An interactive RShiny dashboard for exploring bird trends over time.
- **Web Projects:**  
  - **Django/React:** (See folder `web/django_portfolio` and `web/react_portfolio`) for cloud-based interactive visualizations and data access.

## Species Vocalization Identification

### Overview

This project is designed to identify vocalizations of five species from long-form audio recordings. It is built for ease-of-use, computational efficiency, and field deployment. The pipeline involves:
- **Data Augmentation:** for increasing training sample diversity.
- **Deep Learning Models:** to classify vocalizations.
- **Audio Processing & Detection:** that processes audio chunks to detect and extract species calls.
- **Batch Execution:** Managed via a `.bat` file for simple field deployment.

### Projects & Code

- **model_final.py:** Contains the neural network architecture, training routines, and model evaluation with cross-validation.
- **data_augmentation.py:** Implements several audio augmentation techniques (time stretch, pitch shift, noise addition) to bolster training data.
- **detect_species.py:** Processes long audio recordings in chunks, predicts species calls using a TensorFlow Lite model, and saves the detected calls.
- **run_detection.bat:** A Windows batch script to execute the entire detection pipeline with a single command.

### Field Deployable .bat Executions

This project is optimized for field deployment. The batch script (`run_detection.bat`) allows for easy execution on laptops or portable devices in remote settings. Simply double-click the `.bat` file to start the detection process on new audio recordings.

## Web & Cloud Deployment

I also showcase full-stack development skills with:
- **Django:** A backend API to serve processed data and model predictions.
- **React:** A modern front-end application that communicates with the Django API to provide interactive visualizations.
- **Cloud Deployment:** Docker and Kubernetes configurations are included in the `deployment/` folder for scalable cloud-based deployments.

## Applications
![Plot](images/ecohivelogo.png)

EcoHive is a scientific data management platform designed to ensure integrity, reproducibility, and ease-of-use. Built with the scientific professional in mind, EcoHive is transforming how scientists interact with their data. In Q4 2025, a NLQI layer is slated to be added to EcoHive, stay tuned for this exciting development. 

![Plot](images/ecolog.png)

EcoLog is a scientifc field data collection app that syncs seamlessly with EcoHive. EcoLog, built as a progressive web application, is capable both in the field and in the lab. Collecting data in a remote location? As soon as you gain a connection, your data is automatically sync'd to your backend of choice. Custom fields, data validation, and GPS fuctionality make EcoLog an essential tool for the field researcher. Audio files, media files, or form data...EcoLog handles it all. 

*A demo can be arranged.
